# 📖 Project Overview

Electricity is one of the most important indicators of economic development and industrial growth. This project presents an interactive analysis of electricity consumption across Indian states during **January 2019 to December 2020**, including the period affected by the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

The project combines **Python**, **Flask**, **SQLite**, and **Tableau Public** to transform raw electricity consumption data into an interactive web application. Users can securely log in, explore dashboards, and gain insights into regional and state-wise electricity usage.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

The project analyzes electricity consumption across India before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. It helps identify consumption trends, regional demand variations, and post-lockdown recovery patterns through interactive Tableau dashboards integrated into a Flask web application.

---

# 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze electricity consumption trends.
* Compare state-wise electricity usage.
* Study regional demand variations.
* Understand the impact of COVID-19.
* Build interactive Tableau dashboards.
* Integrate Tableau dashboards into a Flask application.
* Deploy the application for web access.
